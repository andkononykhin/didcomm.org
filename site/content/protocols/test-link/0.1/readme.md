## Roles

![Image](image.jpg)
Provides a `formal name` (using backticks in markdown) for each role in the protocol, says who and how many can play each role, and describes constraints associated with those roles (e.g., "You can only issue a credential if you have a DID on the public ledger"). The issue of qualification for roles can also be explored (e.g., "The holder of the credential must be known to the issuer").
